Andrew Ng Deep Learning Course

During my 1st Year in MIT Manipal, I spent whatever free time I could muster in learning Machine Learning and Coding concepts. This is a repository holding all my assignments that I completed while studying Deep Learning Course of Professor Andrew Ng of Stanford University on Coursera. I completed all the courses in my 2nd semester from September '21 to November '21.
